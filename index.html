						<h2>These are great!</h2>
						<h3>Teri R (@reockerthefrenchie)</h3>
						<p>These are great ! And my dog doesn't even mind them. I’m actually so pleasantly surprised… went on super easy, stayed on, and he didn’t seem to mind them. Within a few minutes he was running up and down the stairs in our house acting like he didn’t even care they were on. Plus they are worth the price just for the laugh 😂😂</p>

						<h2>These are amazing!</h2>
						<h3>Amy G.</h3>
						<p>“These are amazing! I absolutely love them...I did find out they are not definitely for running...she loves to chase that ball ...but when we go play in snow....we love them! She doesn't fight to put them on at all. Thank you. I hope they are a big hit.”</p>

						<h2>They are so well made and easy to put on!</h2>
						<h3>Terri P. @waldobernedoodle</h3>
						<p>We received our WalkeePaws today and it was love at first site! They are so well made and easy to put on. My dog Waldo (Mini Bernedoodle 33lbs) had no trouble at all walking in them.Glad we ordered the size Large as they fit right up to the top of her leg, and therefore more fur will stay dry! We will be recommending to all our “doodle’ friends.</p>
